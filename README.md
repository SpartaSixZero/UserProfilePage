Mac OS X Instructions:

The web app is hosted on port 8080 of localhost started using python simple http server. To do this, simply navigate to the directory with the index file and then type the following command:

sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

I had to add sudo and specify a different port due to an error that I was getting related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
